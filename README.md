# Clone Quotes In Flow

This is the source code for a flow that will clone quotes. The following functionality was implemented:
- Quote Clone with related quote line items
- Check if quote line items have an active price book entry
- Redirect the to the new quote after cloning
- Check if quote line items exist
- Autoversioning name

# Dependencies

This flow uses a Lightning Web Component to redirect to a new record page. @svierk has a good writeup on [medium](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-open-a-record-page-from-salesforce-flow-using-lwc-a8a94bc0c9ba), which explains how this process is done.
